Well hello there! Welcome to Kubify. The Turn-Key DevOps/MLOps OS Developer-First Stack.

But Why?
========

Because Docker-Compose and Terraform are 2 different tools, so I fixed
it.

First class rapid testing, all your services listening for folder
changes, so you can code fast, really fast.

The world needs a Turn-Key Cloud OS solution, so Developers can focus.

Developers need to be able to quickly code and test multiple services, on a REAL full environment.

There is a Developer-Centric need (startup/greenfield/migration/smb) for getting an entire cloud up and running in minutes, rather than years.

Developers and Data Scientists want Self Service.
