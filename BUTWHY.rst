Well hello there! Welcome to Kubify. The Turn-Key DevOps/MLOps OS Developer-First Stack.

But Why?
========

Because Docker-Compose and Terraform are 2 different tools, so I fixed
it.

First class rapid testing, all your services listening for folder
changes, so you can code fast, really fast.

The world needs a Turn-Key Cloud OS solution, so Developers can focus.

Developers need to be able to quickly code and test multiple services, on a REAL full environment.

There is a Developer-Centric need (startup/greenfield/migration/smb) for getting an entire cloud up and running in minutes, rather than years.

Everything you build in Kubify has redundancy ``(dr, backups and active-active)`` and scalability in 2 regions, at the lowest possible cost ``(multiarch, spot, atom processor, spot gpu rapid de-scaling, mlops smart scaling, redundant scalers and more)``.

This is what true turn key feels like. DevOps in 1 day. Developer friendly. Purpose built for Data Scientists and Machine Learning, as well as Developers building services and cloud. Autopilot for DevOps, so your DevOps team can focus on company goals.

Developers and Data Scientists want Self Service.
