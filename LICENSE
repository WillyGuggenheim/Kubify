Do not rebrand. Do not try to sell your own Kubify itself, as it's free.
Kubify is to remain Open Source, Awesome and Free. This is OS and free.
The nature of this repository is OPEN SOURCE and for the COMMUNITY (as it 
always has clearly been), so please contribute back your bug fixes and 
features that would benefit the world. Thank you for CONTRIBUTING to OS..
REMINDER: DO NOT commit any secrets, PII or Access Keys ever (to anywhere).
The goal is to make this an AWS QuickStart OS. This will remain a public repo.
Please create Pull Requests for any awesome features you build in your fork.

Thank you,
Willy Guggenheim
