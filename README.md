# Welcome

Well hello there! Welcome to Kubify. The Turn-Key DevOps OS Stack.


# Awesome !!

Code faster than your Competition. 

Fully Automated. First Class DevEx. Developers-First. Happy Devs. Fixes Spot. No more K8s pains.

You need your own environment, you need to test in real environment, you need to modify multiple services at the same time (without waiting for builds), you need to know your commit works before pushing it and you need the entire cloud on your laptop to do so..


# By Why ?
 
Because Docker-Compose and Terraform are 2 different tools (so I fixed it).
 

# Future State?
 
Fork Terraform and build Docker-Compose, LocalStack & ðŸ›¹ Skater Hot Reloader into it.
 
 
# What do I need?
 
Mac, Linux, Windows or any Docker and AWS.
 
 
# Dependencies For Runtime?
Just Docker (no admin rights required) !!
 
 
# Setup Your AWS Cloud
 
1) Create kms key alias named like kubify_secrets_[env]
2) `./kubify deploy_cloud dev`
 
 
 
# Summary, Install/Reset Workstation
 
 
A) To install/run on your OS directly: `./kubify up`
 
or
 
B) To install/run in a container: `./kubify up_container`
