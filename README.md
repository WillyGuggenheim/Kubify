# Awesome !!
 
Well hello there. Ready to Simulate AWS Cloud Locally??


# By Why ?

Because Docker-Compose and Terraform are 2 different tools (so I fixed it).


# Future State?

Fork Terraform and build Docker-Compose, LocalStack & ðŸ›¹ Skater Hot Reloader into it.


# What do I need?

Mac, Linux, Windows or any Docker and AWS.


# Dependencies For Runtime?
 
Just Docker (no admin rights required) !!


# Setup Your AWS Cloud
 
 
`dev/aws/deploy-or-update-DEV.sh`


# Summary, Install/Reset Workstation


`./kubify up` or `./kubify up_container`
