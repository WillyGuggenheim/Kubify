# Version

9001.0.0


![TURN_KEY_DEVOPS_RAPID_TESTER](./docs/img/README_md_imgs/kubify-arch.drawio.png)


# Welcome!

Well hello there! Welcome to Kubify. The Turn-Key DevOps OS Stack.


# Why?

Because Docker-Compose and Terraform are 2 different tools, so I FIXED it.

Build Services that work perfectly multiple times as fast. Full Self Service. Real Testing.

Magic? Yes. Pure Magic.

Down Side? None.

Awesome.
 

# What do I need to get started?

AWS and/or GCP/AZ (and can be for multi-cloud redundancy reasons, now that your org is 100% automated in Kubify).

You can create a company in the same day with this tool (amazing for startups as well).
 
 
# Dependencies For Runtime?

An AWS account, and that's it. Everything is automated and self contained in a container.

There are no dependancies. How awesome is that. Simple. Get started right away.

# Prerequisites

apple<br>
`make mac`

ubuntu, debian and other debian-based ..<br>
`make deb`

rhel, centos and other epel-based ..<br>
`make epel`

# Deploy Your Cloud

`make cloud`
 

# Start Rapid Testing
  
`make local`


# Rapid Test Workflow

```bash
cd services/example-node-complex-svc
make service
```

All the dependant services will start and will listen for code changes as well. Efficiently edit the entire codebase (of tens or hundres of microservices at your org) in your Pull Request (be the fastest coder, who delivers high quality, fully tested, working code).

If it works on your laptop, it works in dev/prod the SAME, that's what sets us apart. That's the magic.

Code Fast, Seriously Fast. Multi-Service Rapid Testing. Full Self Service. Fully Automated.

# Environment Isolation

Security Minute: You should not give prod access to anyone (but devs need to debug urgent issue in prod). How?
```bash
cd services/example-node-complex-svc
make local prod
```

# What Just Happened?

You are hot patching many services locally (and with the full real environment) without access to data, but with the full real prod!

Kubernetes can be amazing, and it is, with Kubify..

This is what kubernetes was made to do..

![FUTUREOFDEVOPS9000](./docs/img/README_md_imgs/the-future.gif)

Your own REAL FULL environment (local & cloud) anytime you want to code. On-Board in 1 Minute. Entire AWS Cloud on Your Workstation.

Easy Cloud Env, Easy Patching, Easy Version Rollback and Quality Commits, FAST. Work smart and hard at the same time.

The Future, NOW. Developer's Dreams are Coming True Here..


# Who are you?

I have a ton of MLOps and DevOps experience/ I have fixed a common problem (over-the-fence-backlogging).

Kubify has been blessed by AWS and they will contribute as well.

![AWSPARTNER](./docs/img/README_md_imgs/AWS-Partner.jpeg)

We all want self service turn key. It has arrived. No more K8s pains.

You're new/existing infrastructure up immediately in one command
