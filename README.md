# Welcome!

Kubify OS, Version: 9001.0.0

Well hello there! Welcome to Kubify. The Turn-Key MLOps Stack.

# Who is this for?

Data Scientists/Devs/DevOps who want self service.

To rapid develop many services/models fast simultaneously on full real environment.

# Why?

Because Docker-Compose and Terraform are 2 different tools, so I fixed it.

First class rapid testing, all your services listening for folder changes, so you can code fast, really fast. 

If it works on your laptop, it works in dev/prod the SAME, that's what sets us apart. That's the magic.

# How?

DevEx First Class Ideology
