Well hello there! Welcome to Kubify OS Python Package Repo

The Turn-Key DevOps/MLOps OS Developer-First Stack OSS Project

Thank You For Contributing, and Please Do Contribute Code


Who is this for?
================

Data Scientists/Devs/DevOps/MLOps Person/Teams/Companies who want self service and autopilot

To rapid develop many services/models fast simultaneously on full env

1. Automated Self-Service Clouds and Services.
2. Automated DR. Automatic Multi-Cloud Failover.
3. Rapid Test/Develop many Services/Models Simultaneously.
4. Full Automated Integration Test. Stable Prod.

Summary
~~~~~~~

Docker-Compose is a tool for DEVS testing. 

Terraform is a tool for DEVOPS/MLOPS deploying.

Kubify combines the 2 worlds AND lowers your bill.


============
Contributing
============

`make pip` # to install pip dev dependancies or `make develop` to install all dependancies

`make pythons` # test in all supported versions of python in parallel

`make docker` # or click devcontainer green button

`make security` # check code security with bandit scanner

`make test` # run all pytest tests in parallel

`make lint` # run linter tools in all langauges in repo`make format` # autofix `make lint` findings

`make rapid` # to test & optionally version+push

recommended workflow: click the devcontainer 


contributing command
====================


it's as simple as `git commit [] && make rapid` to test+regression+version+push your changes 
    * to this kubify repository as a contributor
    * to the your cicd cloud kubify pipeline(s)

a: contributing.rst
   * includes efficient workflows for contributing to this repo (and for any custom installs) enjoy
b: dev container vscode
   * click the dev container button in your ide of choise (example: visual studio code's green button)
c: github workspaces
   * super efficient on-boarding use case (for installs and contributing): click "."" key in github



base context
============


1. With Kubify, DevOps/MLOps/Dev/DS/Research/SEngineers Write Their terraform/sls/cf/argocd/services/ml Code The Same Way and Test The Same Way, Builing Quality Fast (same codebase 100% between devops/mlops/devs/datascientists/researchers/engineers)

2. To Catch Regression Bugs, Developers Leverage Kubify To Build Full Regression Testing Efficiently Into Their Local Testing Environment With 1 Click/Press (CodeSpaces/VSCode/NotebookServers/DevContainers/CLI/PythonAPI/CI/CD)

1. in the kubify platform, devops/mlops/devs/datascientists/researchers/engineers write code terraform/sls/cf/argocd/services/ml at the same time, the same way, and test the same way, as 1 big team (same codebase)
    * 1 kubify yaml in each `./services/[group][name]` folder `kubify.yml` (rapid test in local/devcontainer/codespaces/notebookservers/vscode all your terraform/sls/cf/argocd/services/ml/aws and the same time)
    * 1 environment yaml, each environment gets 1 auto-versioned environment file (easy to rollback multiple services and easy to uat/clone prod without needing any access to the data to debug anything, solve/debug fast)
2. developers leverage devops/mlops codebase day-in-day-out to test and contribute (if it works on my laptop, it works in prod, that's what makes this different, join-at-the-hip your devops/mlops devs to all of your devs)
3. developers are now more effecienct (1 click/command and you are on-boarded to your code working environment, with a full simulation of the cloud locally, with all dependant services listening for code changes hot reloading)

* join-at-the-hip your devops/mlops hard working software developers with the rest of your hard working software developers with this idea/ideolegy
* autodevops automlops turn-key solution for developers, 1 click/command to on-board developers to your infra and repos, get your devs up and running with a click
* this officially (includes testing) marries your devops/mlops teams to your developer teams for maximum efficiency in itterating (multi-service efficiency and testing full locally)

rapid test real infra and code changes at the same time
* deploy the same way that you code, with the real infra code
* itterate fast when building many-to-many services, really fast
* rapid test your real infra as you code, test and itterate
* know how it will function in the cloud, before you push

happy coding
